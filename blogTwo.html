        <h3 id="typography">‚úîÔ∏è typography</h3>
        <p>The code of typography is the simplest one, all we have to do is write‚å®Ô∏è only some basic 
          <span>
            HTML
          </span>. 
          I had not written any 
          <span>
            CSS
          </span> 
          for this, but you can write it if you wish.
          <br>
          <blockquote>
            <em>
              typography is the art of arranging letters and text in a way that makes written language readable and appealing when displayed.
            </em>
          </blockquote> 
          Its code will look something like this -
          <br>
          <br>
          <script src="https://gist.github.com/hsnice16/9cd768548c89daf452aaa08b7ba3d097.js"></script> 
          And finally, it will look something like this -
          <br>
          <br> 
          <img class="blog-img" src="Illustrations/blog_typography.jpg">
          <br> 
          This is all that we have to do for typography. let us move on to our next section, 
          <span>
            containers
          </span>
          . 
        </p>
        
        <hr>
        
        <h3 id="containers">‚úîÔ∏è containers</h3>
        <p>In my viewpoint, mostly we use two types of containers.
          <br>
          <br> 
          <span>
            fluid container
          </span> 
          :- this spreads from left end to right end. 
          <span>
            center container
          </span> 
          :- And this, as the name suggests, spreads in the center.
          <br>
          <br> 
          The 
          <span>
            HTML
          </span> 
          code for containers has only 5 
          <span>
            tags
          </span>
          . So you can think, How simple it will be? And 5 tags will look like this -
          <br>
          <script src="https://gist.github.com/hsnice16/b218c34c0a5137a67fdd57a7a0968efe.js"></script>
          <blockquote>
            Okay okay, it has only 3 unique tags üò≤.
          </blockquote> 
          We will style containers, as we have to spread a container in the center. And we will also give them some padding, so they look nice.
          <br>
          Its 
          <span>
            CSS
          </span> 
          code will look something like this -
          <br>
          <br>
          <script src="https://gist.github.com/hsnice16/a6502c5303b90a9494603a6d379b8c83.js"></script> 
          And finally, it will look like this -
          <br>
          <br> 
          <img class="blog-img" src="Illustrations/blog_container.jpg">
          <br> 
          We are done with containers too. Let us discuss 
          <span>
            links
          </span> 
          now.
        </p>
        
        <hr>
        
        <h3 id="links">‚úîÔ∏è links</h3>
        <p> 
          As of my knowledge, basically links are of two types :
          <br> 
          &nbsp;&nbsp; The first one is, on which we want users to focus more, known as 
          <span>
            Primary Link
          </span>.
          <br> 
          &nbsp;&nbsp; And the second one is that on which we don't want users to focus more, known as 
          <span>
            Secondary Link
          </span>.
          <br>
          <br> 
          Writing 
          <span>
            HTML
          </span> 
          code for this is very simple, we have to include anchor tags for this. And its code will look something like this -
          <br>
          <script src="https://gist.github.com/hsnice16/d3b757f1306cb6edf2e78e70df2454db.js"></script> 
          And when we 
          <span>
            style
          </span> 
          them, using the following codes -
          <br>
          <br>
          <script src="https://gist.github.com/hsnice16/bfd9da9676a1e08b435d791e2b76c911.js"></script> 
          They look like this -
          <br>
          <br> 
          <img class="blog-img" src="Illustrations/blog_link.jpg">
          <br> 
          We have completed the links. let's discuss 
          <span>
            lists
          </span> 
          now. 
        </p>
        
        <hr>
        
        <h3 id="lists">‚úîÔ∏è lists</h3>
        <p> 
          For this small component library, I added only three types of lists.
          <ol>
            <li><span>Unordered list(without bullets)</span></li>
            <li><span>Unordered inline list</span></li>
            <li><span>Reverse ordered list</span></li>
          </ol> The HTML codes for which is -
          <br>
          <br>
          <script src="https://gist.github.com/hsnice16/cae2cfe669d26b5c8e081e79a6582d56.js"></script> 
          Finally, it will look something like this -
          <br>
          <br> 
          <img class="blog-img" src="Illustrations/blog_list.jpg">
          <br> 
          But with only 
          <span>
            HTML
          </span> 
          we will not get the above result, for that we have to add some 
          <span>
            CSS
          </span> 
          too. And codes for that is -
          <br>
          <br>
          <script src="https://gist.github.com/hsnice16/d6a072256a8d663d18fc96d33a8e2b09.js"></script> 
          We have completed the reading of four sections out of eight üòé. Now let us discuss our next section, which is an interesting one, next is the 
          <span>
            nav
          </span>. 
        </p>
        
        <hr>
        
        <h3 id="nav">‚úîÔ∏è nav</h3>
        <p>
          <blockquote> 
            A navigation bar is a user interface element within a webpage that contains links to other sections of the website.
            <br>
            <br> 
            Mostly through the navbar, users can navigate between different routes on our web page. 
          </blockquote> 
          For different links, we can use the 
          <span>
            Unordered inline list
          </span>
          , that we had created in the lists section. Full 
          <span>
            HTML
          </span> 
          code for nav will look something like the following -
          <br>
          <br>
          <script src="https://gist.github.com/hsnice16/1512098833dd28e6372a80d62b54adae.js"></script> 
          The final look of the navbar, that you will see from the 
          <span>
            Final Look
          </span> 
          link (above), is like the following -
          <br>
          <br> 
          <img class="blog-img" src="Illustrations/blog_nav.jpg">
          <br> 
          To get the above styling, you can add the following lines of 
          <span>
            CSS
          </span> -
          <br>
          <br>
          <script src="https://gist.github.com/hsnice16/132f85101cd1d52202dca0fa91edf3e6.js"></script> 
          That's all that we have to do for our navbar, now we can discuss our next section, which is the 
          <span>
            header
          </span>
          . 
        </p>
        
        <hr>
        
        <h3 id="header">‚úîÔ∏è header</h3>
        <p> 
          In the header, we mostly use our hero image and add some hero heading.
          <br>
          And for this component library, I did the same. In the 
          <span>
            HTML code
          </span> 
          for the header, I used an img tag for adding our image and an h1 tag for the hero heading. Codes for which finally looks like the following -
          <br>
          <script src="https://gist.github.com/hsnice16/db5d38cad030940f5b7add3dc6285418.js"></script> 
          To adjust the image size and to style hero heading, and for their alignment, we have to use 
          <span>
            CSS
          </span>
          . Its code will look like this -
          <br>
          <br>
          <script src="https://gist.github.com/hsnice16/755d23f46a38db186dd31014c56124b9.js"></script> 
          In the end, it will look like this -
          <br>
          <br> 
          <img class="blog-img" src="Illustrations/blog_header.jpg">
          <br> 
          Lets we start discussing the remaining two sections for this blog. We will start with the 
          <span>
            section
          </span> 
          next. 
        </p>
        
        <hr>
        
        <h3 id="section">‚úîÔ∏è section</h3>
        <p> 
          For this small component library, I have included two types of sections. One with 
          <span>
            no
          </span> 
          background and one with 
          <span>
            off-white
          </span> 
          background.
          <br>
          They both are center containers, that we had made in the 
          <span>
            containers section
          </span>
          .
          <blockquote> 
            The reason for keeping them center containers is that it does not seem good to anyone when they have to move their neck to read long text from the left end to the right end. It seems good in the center, they can read it for a long. 
          </blockquote> 
          For 
          <span>
            HTML code
          </span>
          , I have written some placeholder text. The codes are mentioned below for each section separately.
          <br>
          <br> 
          Code for Section 1 -
          <br>

          <span>
            Section 1

          <img class="blog-img" src="Illustrations/blog_section_2.jpg">
          <br> 
          As we had discussed that one of the sections will contain 
          <span>
            off-white
          </span> 
          background. So to do that we have to include some 
          <span>
            CSS
          </span>
          . Code for that is given below -

          Now lets we discuss the last section of this blog, the 
          <span>
            footer

          section.

          code for 
          <span>
            footer
          </span> 
          is given below. It contains the same 
          <span>
            Unordered inline list
          </span>
          , that we had created in the lists section. And had used in 
          <span>
            nav
          </span>
          .
          <br>

          To style the footer, we need the below-mentioned CSS codes. We have given it some 
          <span>
            background color
          </span>
          , 
          <span>
            text color
          </span>
          , and to give it a little curve shape a 
          <span>
            top-right

          radius.

          <span>
            CSS
          </span> 
          codes, finally, it will look something like this -
